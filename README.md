# Bumblebee

## Minimal tiny transformer framework for LLM learning and studying

Bumblebee is a simple, lightweight and playful framework for learning and experimenting training and finetuning LLM from scratch. The framework and the implementation is deliberately inspired from "Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)" by Sebastian Ratschka.

## Training and finetuning tutorials

* [Pretrain a LLM on a minimal textbook](scripts/pretrain_gpt_textbook.py)
* [Load a pretrained LLM and run eval on simple prompt](scripts/load_and_infer_openai_gpt2.py)
* [Finetune a LLM on SMS Spam classification](scripts/finetune_gpt_instruct_sft.py)
* [Finetune a LLM for Instruction Supervised Finetuning](scripts/finetune_gpt_instruct_sft.py)

## Supported models

* OpenAI GPT2
